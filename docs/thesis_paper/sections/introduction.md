# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background
Travelers seeking visa information often face inconsistent, outdated, or inaccessible official websites. Japan, in particular, has visa policies that vary by nationality, purpose, and length of stay.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional chatbots struggle to provide up-to-date and context-sensitive visa information. Static rule-based systems or generic language models often hallucinate or fail to handle real-world questions.

## 1.3 Objective
The goal of this research is to develop a RAG-based chatbot enhanced with a custom-trained intent classifier to deliver accurate and contextually relevant visa answers.
