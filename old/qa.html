      <td>What are the difference between tourists and visit relative or friend visa?</td>
      <td>The primary differences between a tourist visa and a visa for visiting relatives or friends when applying through Attic Tours are based on the purpose of the visit and the specific requirements for each type of visa.\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - **Tourist Visa**: This visa is intended for individuals visiting Japan for tourism purposes, such as sightseeing, leisure, and exploring the country.\n   - **Visa for Visiting Relatives or Friends**: This visa is specifically for individuals who are visiting relatives or friends residing in Japan, whether they are close relatives or distant relatives.\n\n2. **Requirements**:\n   - **Tourist Visa**:\n     - Passport with a holder's signature.\n     - Application form with a facial photo.\n     - PSA issued birth certificate and marriage certificate (for married applicants) issued within 1 year (not necessary if there is a used Japan visa).\n     - Itinerary in Japan.\n     - Bank certificate, tax payment certificate, and employment certificate may be required to demonstrate financial capability.\n\n   - **Visa for Visiting Relatives or Friends**:\n     - Similar to the tourist visa, but with additional requirements to prove the relationship with the inviter.\n     - Invitation letter from the relative or friend in Japan.\n     - Proof of relationship (such as birth certificates or marriage certificates) to establish the connection with the inviter.\n     - Additional documents specific to the inviter (such as residence certificate, photocopy of their passport, and statement of service).\n\n3. **Financial Documentation**:\n   - Both types may require financial documentation, but the specifics may vary based on whether the applicant or the inviter is shouldering the travel expenses.\n\nOverall, while both visas share some common requirements, the key difference lies in the purpose of travel and the need for relationship verification for the visa to visit relatives or friends.
