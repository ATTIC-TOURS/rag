# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background
Japan requires foreign nationals to secure a visa before entry, with conditions varying by the applicant’s nationality, purpose of visit, and local circumstances (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan [MOFA], n.d.-a). For Filipino nationals, visas are mandatory, and requirements differ according to visit purpose—such as tourism, business, or visiting relatives. The Embassy of Japan in the Philippines provides official documentation outlining these requirements, which are subject to periodic updates (Embassy of Japan in the Philippines, n.d.).

Recent statistics show that the number of Filipino nationals entering Japan has been increasing again since 2021, reflecting the strong travel demand between the two countries (MOFA, 2023). This growing demand contributes to a high volume of visa-related inquiries, many of which are directed to accredited travel agencies. However, travel agencies face difficulties in promptly responding to inquiries received through platforms like Facebook Messenger. Survey results with a partner agency (Appendix G) indicate challenges such as workload, response delays, and repeated questions about visa requirements.

Chatbots are increasingly adopted across industries to improve customer service and efficiency. In the hospitality sector, Gupta, Dheekonda, and Masum (2024) introduced Genie, a restaurant chatbot that manages reservations, menu inquiries, and frequently asked questions using predefined responses. In specialized domains, Huang et al. (2022) developed a legal chatbot based on retrieval augmentation to provide regulation-specific answers, while Tunstall et al. (2023) demonstrated that retrieval-augmented approaches in business and customer service improve usability and trustworthiness.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance large language models (LLMs) by combining information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained parameters, RAG retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base and grounds the generated response on this evidence (Lewis et al., 2020).

The retrieval process relies on embeddings—vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning—and vector databases that enable efficient similarity search (Johnson, Douze, & Jégou, 2019). A top-k retrieval strategy is commonly used to select the most relevant documents, ensuring that the generated response is factually grounded. A well-documented limitation of LLMs is hallucination, where the model produces plausible but inaccurate outputs. RAG mitigates this risk by anchoring responses to retrieved evidence, thereby increasing factual reliability (Ji et al., 2023).

Messenger was selected as the deployment platform for this study because it is the most widely used messaging application in the Philippines, with over 80% of the population actively engaging on the platform (Meltwater, 2025). This ensures that the target users are already familiar with the interface, minimizing adoption barriers compared to alternative platforms.

For the prototype implementation, deployment is limited to a local PC connected via ngrok to enable secure tunneling and integration with Messenger. While constrained by budget and time, this setup is sufficient to demonstrate feasibility during the development phase.

In the Philippines, Japan visa inquiries on Messenger are commonly expressed in Tagalog, English, or a mixture of both (Taglish). This practice reflects everyday communication habits but creates additional interpretation challenges for customer service staff, as inquiries are often phrased informally, with inconsistent grammar or spelling. Designing a chatbot capable of processing mixed-language inputs is therefore essential for practical usability in this setting.

Although chatbots and AI-driven assistants are widely used in customer service, few are tailored to Japan visa applications in the Philippine context. Existing solutions often rely on static FAQ lists, which cannot adequately handle dynamic, document-driven, or multilingual inquiries. There is also a lack of localized implementations of RAG-based chatbots deployed on accessible platforms like Messenger, despite the evident need for faster and more consistent responses.

This study addresses this gap by designing, developing, and evaluating a RAG-based chatbot for Japan visa inquiries in Messenger. By incorporating multilingual support and testing in collaboration with a travel agency partner, the project directly responds to the research objectives outlined in Section 1.3.
