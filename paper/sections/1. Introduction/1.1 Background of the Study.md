## 1.1 Background
Chatbots are increasingly being adopted across various industries to enhance customer service and operational efficiency, with the restaurant sector providing a clear example. For instance, (Gupta, Dheekonda, & Masum, 2024) introduced a chatbot named Genie, which efficiently handles customer inquiries about reservations, menus, and frequently asked questions using predefined responses. While this rule-based approach has proven effective for routine queries, it lacks the flexibility and depth of understanding that large language models (LLMs) offer. However, LLM-based chatbots face a significant limitation: once trained, they cannot automatically incorporate new information and must be retrained with updated datasets to remain accurate and relevant—a process that is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. This challenge can be addressed through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an approach that allows LLMs to dynamically retrieve and integrate the most current information from external sources, enabling more adaptive, informative, and contextually relevant responses without the need for constant retraining.

This capability is especially beneficial in industries where information frequently changes and must be tailored to individual cases, such as travel agencies in the Philippines that assist clients with obtaining Japan visas. These agencies manage a high volume of inquiries related to the required documents for different visa types, including tourist, business, and family-related visits. While (Embassy of Japan in the Philippines, 2025) provides general visa requirements on its website, these guidelines are often not exhaustive. Many supporting documents—especially those that serve as proof of the applicant’s specific purpose for visiting—are not publicly listed but are essential for successful applications. For example, if the applicant is visiting Japan to care for a child, they must submit a baby book; if the visit is for medical reasons, a medical certificate is typically required. These specialized documents vary depending on the applicant’s situation and are typically known only to travel agencies, who stay informed through frequent updates and experience.

As a result, clients often seek clarification before visiting the agency to avoid delays or multiple trips due to incomplete submissions. A large number of these inquiries are made via messaging platforms, particularly Facebook Messenger, which is commonly used in the Philippines for casual and business communication. While convenient, manually responding to each message consumes time and resources, especially when questions are repetitive or case-specific. Implementing a RAG-based chatbot system within these messaging platforms would allow travel agencies to automatically provide real-time, accurate, and context-aware answers to client inquiries. This solution would not only reduce the workload of staff but also improve client preparedness, enhance satisfaction, and streamline the overall Japan visa application process.
