## 1.2 Problem Statement
As the demand for Japan visas continues to grow in the Philippines, travel agencies have become essential intermediaries in helping applicants navigate the often complex and evolving requirements set by the Japan Embassy. However, despite the availability of general information on the Embassy’s official website, many applicants still struggle to understand what specific documents are needed based on their unique travel purposes. This confusion results in frequent inquiries—particularly through platforms like Facebook Messenger—and inefficiencies in the application process. These challenges highlight several key problems faced by both clients and agencies:

- Incomplete and non-public visa information:
The Japan Embassy in the Philippines provides only general documentation requirements online, while many situational documents—such as baby books for childcare-related visits or medical certificates for health-related travel—are not publicly listed. Travel agencies possess this knowledge through experience and updates, but applicants often lack access to it, leading to confusion and unprepared visits.

- High volume of repetitive, case-specific inquiries via Messenger:
Clients frequently reach out to travel agencies through Facebook Messenger to ask about Japan visa requirements, particularly for unique or changing cases. Responding manually to these repetitive inquiries consumes significant staff time and limits the agency’s ability to focus on more complex tasks.

- Inefficiencies in the visa application process:
Due to a lack of clear, accessible, and real-time information, many applicants arrive at travel agencies with incomplete documents, resulting in delays, repeat visits, and frustration. This creates inefficiencies in both client service and internal agency operations, signaling the need for a more adaptive and automated communication solution.
