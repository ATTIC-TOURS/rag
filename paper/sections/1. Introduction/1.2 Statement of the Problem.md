## 1.2 Problem Statement

Applying for a Japan visa in the Philippines is often confusing due to complex requirements, evolving documentation, and limited access to timely information. Applicants frequently depend on travel agencies and the Embassy website, but these channels cannot always provide immediate responses, leading to delays and added workload for agencies.

Although chatbots and AI systems are increasingly used in information services, few are tailored to Japan visa applications. Existing chatbots typically rely on static FAQs, which are insufficient for handling dynamic and document-driven queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution by combining reliable information retrieval with conversational response generation. However, there is still a lack of localized implementations focusing on Japan visa assistance through accessible platforms like Facebook Messenger.

This study therefore addresses the following problems:

1. How can a RAG-based chatbot assistant be designed and developed to provide accurate and low-latency responses on Japan visa requirements?

2. How can a retrieval system be implemented to access and organize visa-related documents from trusted sources?

3. How can the chatbot be integrated into Messenger to ensure accessibility and real-time responses?

4. How can multilingual support (English, Tagalog, Japanese) be incorporated to widen usability?

5. How effective is the prototype in terms of accuracy, usability, and user satisfaction compared with manual inquiry handling?

6. To what extent can the chatbot reduce the workload of travel agencies in answering routine visa-related inquiries?
