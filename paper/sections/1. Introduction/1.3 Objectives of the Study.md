This study aims to develop a practical solution that addresses the challenges faced by travel agencies in responding to Japan visa-related inquiries, particularly through messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger. The solution focuses on enhancing service efficiency, improving client satisfaction, and streamlining the visa application process using a chatbot integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities.

### 1.3.1 General Objective
To build a prototype chatbot integrated into Facebook Messenger that can answer client inquiries regarding Japan visa requirements, serving as a foundational tool for future development in the travel agency sector aimed at enhancing service efficiency, improving client satisfaction, and streamlining the Japan visa application process.

### 1.3.2 Specific Objectives

1. To collect and create a relevant dataset from one of the travel agencies based on updated Japan visa requirements and real-world inquiries in order to build and evaluate the chatbotâ€™s performance.

2. To design and develop a model that simplifies user queries before retrieving the relevant information.

3. To fine-tune the generator model in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using the collected dataset to improve the quality and relevance of the chatbot's responses.

4. To build a working prototype of the chatbot that effectively answers Japan visa-related inquiries through Messenger, offering real-time, context-aware, and updated responses.
