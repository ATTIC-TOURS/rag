## 1.3 Objective
The objectives of this study are formulated to define the direction and intended outcomes of the research. They serve as a guide in addressing the research problem and in aligning the scope and methodology with the expected contributions of the study. The objectives are divided into a general objective, which presents the overall aim of the study, and specific objectives, which outline the concrete steps necessary to achieve that aim.

### 1.3.1 General Objective
The general objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot assistant for Japan visa requirements, deployed through Facebook Messenger, in order to enhance the accessibility of visa-related information and support users in understanding the application process.

### 1.3.2 Specific Objectives
To achieve the general objective, this study pursues the following specific objectives:

1. To design and develop a cost-effective, low-latency prototype of a RAG-based chatbot assistant focused on Japan visa requirements and processes.

2. To implement a structured retrieval system that integrates visa-related documents (requirements, processes, and guidelines) from official sources such as the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines and trusted travel agencies.

3. To integrate the chatbot into Facebook Messenger via API to provide real-time access to end-users.

4. To provide multilingual support by enabling responses in English and Tagalog, and offering experimental Japanese responses through machine translation.

5. To evaluate the performance of the prototype in terms of accuracy, latency, usability, and user satisfaction, in collaboration with a partner travel agency.

6. To compare the efficiency of the prototype against existing manual inquiry-handling processes in order to assess its potential for reducing workload in travel agencies.
