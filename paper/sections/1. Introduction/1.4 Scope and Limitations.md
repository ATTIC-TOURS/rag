## 1.4 Scope and Limitations

This study focuses on the design and development of an artificial intelligence (AI) prototype utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The prototype serves as a chatbot assistant for inquiries related to Japan visa applications and is integrated into the Facebook Messenger platform through an API connection. As international travel processes often involve complex requirements and multiple documents, the system aims to assist users in understanding the necessary steps and compiling the needed documents to apply for a Japan visa. The project does not replace official consultation services; rather, it complements them by streamlining access to public information in a conversational format.

### 1.4.1 Scope of the Study

The primary objective of this study is to develop and build a first-stage development prototype of an AI RAG-based chatbot assistant for Japan visa applications, delivered via Messenger. The scope of the system includes the following:

#### Functional Requirements

- Provide Japan visa requirements.

- Answer queries in English, Tagalog, and Japanese.

- Indicate the condition of required documents (e.g., validity, notarization, or certification needs).

- Give information about the overall Japan visa process, from application to visa issuance.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- Operate within Messenger through a Facebook page.

- Streamline the flow from user inquiry to chatbot response.

- Function as an information assistant, not as an official consultant on visa approval or eligibility.

- Utilize datasets obtained from one of the biggest Japan travel agencies and the official Embassy of Japan in the Philippines website under visa services.

- Evaluate the reliability, efficiency, and correctness of the prototype in collaboration with a Japan travel agency.

### 1.4.2 Limitations of the Study

Despite its intended contributions, this study acknowledges several limitations:

1. Visa process information is limited to one of the biggest Japan travel agencies and the official Embassy of Japan in the Philippines website. As such, the chatbot cannot provide general or comprehensive answers for all Japan visa processes.

2. The prototype does not consider the security aspects of the API, since the focus is on first-stage development rather than production deployment.

3. The system runs on a local PC and uses NGROK to serve responses to Messenger through the Meta webhook. Cloud deployment and staging are excluded due to budget and time constraints.

4. The large language model (LLM) and embedding model used are from OpenAI. No custom model training was performed in order to focus on optimizing the retrieval system within the RAG framework.

5. Japanese responses are generated primarily through translation outputs from the LLM and are not derived from native-curated datasets.

6. The system does not collect, store, or process personal applicant data. Interactions are strictly limited to providing information from public sources.

7. The prototype is designed specifically for the Japan visa process in the Philippines and is not generalized to other embassies, consulates, or countries.


This study is scoped to the development of a first-stage prototype of a RAG-based AI chatbot for Japan visa assistance. The system focuses on providing visa requirements, process information, and multilingual support within the Messenger platform. Its limitations include the use of restricted datasets, reliance on third-party LLMs, local deployment with NGROK, and the exclusion of security and scalability considerations. By clearly defining both scope and limitations, this study positions itself as an exploratory effort toward AI-assisted visa inquiry systems rather than a comprehensive, production-ready solution.
