## 1.4 Scope and Limitations

This study focuses on the design and development of an artificial intelligence (AI) prototype utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The prototype functions as a chatbot assistant for inquiries related to Japan visa requirements and processes, integrated into the Facebook Messenger platform through an API connection. The system aims to assist Filipino users by providing accurate and accessible information in a conversational format, thereby improving inquiry handling without replacing official consultation services.

### 1.4.1 Scope of the Study

The scope of this study is limited to the first-stage development of a prototype RAG-based chatbot assistant for Japan visa applications, specifically targeting the visa requirements and process flow as published by official and trusted sources. The scope includes:

#### Functional Requirements

1. Provide up-to-date Japan visa requirements as published by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines and partner travel agencies.

2. Answer user queries in English, Tagalog, and Japanese (the latter via machine translation).

3. Indicate the conditions of required documents (e.g., validity period, notarization, or certification needs).

4. Provide general information on the Japan visa process, from document preparation to submission.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Operate within Facebook Messenger through a dedicated page.

2. Deliver responses with low latency in a streamlined conversational flow.

3. Function strictly as an information assistant, without offering visa eligibility assessment or approval.

4. Use datasets obtained from one of the largest Japan travel agencies and the official Embassy of Japan in the Philippines website.

5. Evaluate prototype performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction, in collaboration with a partner travel agency.

### 1.4.2 Limitations of the Study

Despite its intended contributions, the study acknowledges the following limitations:

1. Data Coverage: Information is restricted to publicly available datasets from one Japan travel agency and the official Embassy of Japan in the Philippines. The chatbot cannot provide comprehensive answers for all visa scenarios.

2. System Deployment: The prototype operates on a local PC using NGROK for Messenger integration. Cloud deployment, staging, and enterprise-grade hosting are excluded due to budget and time constraints.

3. Security & Scalability: Security considerations (e.g., API protection, data encryption) and scalability features are not included, as the focus is limited to prototype functionality.

4. Model Dependence: The system relies on third-party large language models (LLMs) and embeddings from OpenAI, without custom model training. Optimization is focused on the retrieval mechanism within the RAG framework.

5. Multilingual Support: English and Tagalog queries are prioritized. Japanese responses are experimental, generated primarily via machine translation rather than native-curated datasets.

6. Geographical Scope: The prototype is designed exclusively for Japan visa processes applicable in the Philippines and is not generalized for other embassies or countries.

7. User Data: The system does not collect, store, or process any personal applicant information. It is limited to providing responses based solely on public visa documentation.
