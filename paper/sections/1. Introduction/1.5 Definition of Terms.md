## 1.5 Definition of Terms

To ensure clarity and consistency, the following key terms are defined as they are used in this study:

* **Chatbot** – An AI-powered conversational system designed to simulate human interaction by interpreting user inputs and generating relevant responses in natural language.

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – A framework that combines *retrieval* of relevant documents from a knowledge base with *generation* of responses by a large language model (LLM). This approach improves factual accuracy by grounding answers in external sources.

* **Large Language Model (LLM)** – A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. In this study, the LLM is responsible for producing responses based on retrieved visa-related information.

* **Binary Classifier** – A lightweight machine learning model that categorizes user queries into two classes: *Japan visa–related* and *non–visa-related*. This reduces unnecessary retrieval and improves system efficiency.

* **Precision** – An evaluation metric that measures the proportion of correctly identified positive cases (e.g., visa-related queries) out of all cases classified as positive by the model.

* **Recall** – An evaluation metric that measures the proportion of actual positive cases (e.g., visa-related queries) that are correctly identified by the model.

* **F1-Score** – The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a classifier’s performance.

* **Vector Database** – A specialized database that stores high-dimensional vector embeddings of text, enabling similarity search and retrieval of semantically related information.

* **Embedding** – The numerical representation of text in a dense vector space, allowing semantic similarity between words, sentences, or documents to be measured.

* **RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Suite)** – An evaluation framework designed to measure the quality of RAG systems using metrics such as faithfulness, accuracy, context recall, and context precision.

* **System Usability Scale (SUS)** – A standardized 10-item questionnaire used to evaluate the usability of interactive systems, producing a score from 0 to 100.

* **Latency** – The time taken for the chatbot to process a user query and return a response. In this study, latency is reported at the median and 95th percentile.

* **Synthetic Data** – Artificially generated data created by a large language model to supplement real-world datasets. In this study, synthetic queries expand the training and evaluation data for the classifier and RAG pipeline.

* **Visa Requirements** – The official set of documents, conditions, and procedures issued by the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines that applicants must satisfy to obtain a visa.
