## 1.5 Significance of the Study
This study is significant because it applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to a specialized and practical context: assisting Filipino applicants with Japan visa inquiries. While chatbot and RAG systems have been explored in general domains, their adaptation to government-related services in multilingual or code-switched environments has been limited.

The study highlights the practical importance of combining official visa requirements with curated resources from travel agencies to build a retrieval system capable of addressing real applicant questions. To strengthen coverage and reduce response latency, synthetic data generated through large language models was also used to augment the knowledge base. This ensures that the system can efficiently provide relevant information without over-relying on retrieval at every step.

Another point of significance is the integration of the RAG pipeline into Meta Messenger, a widely used platform in the Philippines. This makes the system more accessible to Filipino applicants who naturally seek assistance through mobile and social messaging applications.

Overall, the study demonstrates how recent advances in natural language processing can be adapted to:

1. Provide a more accessible information channel for visa applicants.

2. Support travel agencies and consular services by reducing repetitive inquiries.

3. Explore the effective combination of curated and synthetic data for domain-specific RAG applications.
