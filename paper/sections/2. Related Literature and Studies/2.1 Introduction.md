# 2.Related Literature and Studies

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and natural language processing has led to the development of systems capable of delivering accurate, efficient, and context-aware responses to user queries. One of the most promising approaches is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines the strengths of information retrieval and large language models to provide grounded, up-to-date answers. In recent years, RAG-based systems have been applied in domains such as education, healthcare, customer service, and government support, reflecting their versatility and growing importance.

This chapter presents a review of both literature and studies relevant to the development of a RAG-based chatbot prototype for Japan visa assistance in the Philippines. The related literature discusses the technical foundations, including embeddings, retrieval methods, indexing techniques, reranking strategies, and evaluation metrics. The related studies highlight practical implementations of chatbots and RAG systems in various domains, particularly those aligned with public information services and multilingual support. Finally, the synthesis connects these insights, identifies research gaps, and justifies the novelty of the proposed thesis prototype.
