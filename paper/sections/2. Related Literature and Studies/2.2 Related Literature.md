## 2.2 Related Literature

Developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot for Japan visa assistance requires grounding in several areas of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and evaluation frameworks. This section reviews relevant literature on embeddings, retrieval mechanisms, classification, chunking, indexing, hybrid retrieval, and evaluation methods, highlighting their importance for building a reliable prototype system.

### Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning at the word, sentence, or document level (Mikolov et al., 2013). By mapping linguistic units into high-dimensional space, embeddings enable similarity computation between queries and documents through measures such as cosine similarity (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). This is critical for semantic search in the Japan visa chatbot, as users may phrase inquiries in diverse ways across English, Tagalog, and Japanese. Without embeddings, the system would rely only on keyword matching, which risks missing contextually relevant documents. By using embeddings, the chatbot can compare semantic meaning and retrieve the most relevant requirements for applicants.

### Retriever

The retriever is the component responsible for selecting candidate documents from a knowledge base. Retrievers can be based on keyword search, semantic search, or hybrid approaches (Karpukhin et al., 2020). In a RAG pipeline, the retriever identifies potentially relevant visa requirement documents, which are later passed to a re-ranking model such as a cross-encoder for improved precision (Nogueira & Cho, 2019). This ensures that the chatbot does not overwhelm the language model with irrelevant content, while still grounding responses on domain-specific knowledge. For the Japan visa assistant, efficient retrieval is essential because the knowledge base includes both travel agency datasets and embassy guidelines.

### Classifier

A lightweight classifier can be integrated before retrieval to determine whether a query is relevant to Japan visa inquiries. This pre-retrieval classification step reduces computational cost by skipping unnecessary retrieval when the query falls outside the scope of the chatbot (Joachims, 1998). Techniques such as logistic regression combined with TF-IDF or embeddings are effective for this task due to their efficiency and interpretability. By filtering unrelated queries, the system streamlines the RAG pipeline and improves overall response time for users.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a framework that combines neural retrieval models with large language models (LLMs), grounding generated answers in external documents (Lewis et al., 2020). This reduces hallucination, ensures responses are tied to up-to-date visa requirements, and allows adaptation to specific domains. For the Japan visa chatbot, RAG ensures that answers are fact-based and aligned with embassy and agency information, rather than relying solely on the LLMâ€™s pre-trained but outdated knowledge.

### Chunking

Chunking refers to dividing documents into smaller units, such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections, to improve retrieval accuracy (Lee et al., 2019). Effective chunking increases the likelihood that the retriever surfaces only the most relevant pieces of information rather than entire lengthy documents. For example, when a user asks about financial requirements for a tourist visa, only the specific section on bank certificates should be retrieved instead of the entire visa application guideline. Proper chunking enhances precision while reducing the context length passed to the LLM.

### Indexing

Efficient indexing is necessary to support fast document retrieval. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs are widely used in vector databases (Malkov & Yashunin, 2018). HNSW enables scalable search in high-dimensional embedding spaces while maintaining good recall and latency trade-offs. This indexing approach is directly relevant to the Japan visa chatbot, where multiple visa categories and document requirements must be stored and accessed rapidly.

### Retrieval

Several retrieval techniques are commonly applied in RAG pipelines. Keyword-based methods such as TF-IDF (Salton & Buckley, 1988) and BM25 (Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009) excel in exact term matching, while semantic search using embeddings retrieves documents based on contextual meaning. Hybrid search combines these methods, leveraging the precision of keyword matching and the generalization of embeddings (Luan et al., 2021). In this study, an 80% semantic and 20% keyword hybrid search is adopted to balance accuracy and recall. Furthermore, retrieval may include pre-filtering with classifiers and re-ranking with cross-encoders to refine document selection. This layered retrieval strategy ensures that the chatbot surfaces the most accurate and relevant information for users.

### Evaluation Methods

Evaluating RAG systems requires assessing both retrieval and generation. Retrieval quality is typically measured using precision and recall (Manning et al., 2008), ensuring that the documents surfaced are both accurate and comprehensive. For generation, metrics such as correctness and faithfulness are critical (Honovich et al., 2022). Correctness checks whether generated answers align with factual content, while faithfulness verifies grounding in retrieved evidence. In the Japan visa chatbot, high retrieval precision ensures embassy and agency requirements are surfaced correctly, while faithful generation prevents misleading or hallucinated responses. A combined evaluation framework thus ensures trustworthiness, which is essential in sensitive domains like visa applications.
