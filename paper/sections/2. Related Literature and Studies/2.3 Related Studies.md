## 2.3 Related Studies

Several existing studies provide foundations for the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbots applied to domain-specific tasks such as visa inquiry support.

A study by Lewis et al. (2020) introduced the RAG framework, combining dense retrieval with generative models to improve factual consistency and reduce hallucinations in responses. This approach demonstrated that augmenting large language models (LLMs) with retrieved documents could ground outputs in real knowledge sources, which is directly relevant to building a chatbot that provides accurate Japan visa requirements.

Subsequent work by Karpukhin et al. (2020) on Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) improved the efficiency of retrieval systems by embedding both queries and passages into the same semantic space. Their results highlight the importance of embedding-based retrieval for domain-specific systems where high accuracy is needed, such as ensuring the correct identification of visa application requirements.

In applied contexts, Chen et al. (2022) evaluated hybrid search methods combining TF-IDF, BM25, and semantic embeddings to optimize document retrieval for chatbots. Their study showed that hybrid search significantly outperforms purely semantic or purely keyword-based retrieval in terms of precision and recall. This directly supports the design choice of integrating both semantic search (80%) and keyword-based retrieval (20%) in the proposed RAG-based chatbot system for visa inquiries.

Domain-focused chatbot studies also provide valuable insights. Huang et al. (2022) developed a legal-domain chatbot grounded in retrieval-based augmentation, achieving strong performance in providing reliable, regulation-specific answers. Similarly, Tunstall et al. (2023) highlighted the application of retrieval augmentation in specialized business and customer-service scenarios, showing that domain-constrained datasets improve the chatbotâ€™s practical usability and trustworthiness. These findings underscore the feasibility of adapting RAG pipelines to the Japan visa domain.

Finally, Wang et al. (2023) proposed evaluation metrics for RAG systems, emphasizing precision and recall in retrieval as well as correctness and faithfulness in generation. Their work provides methodological guidance for evaluating the proposed prototype to ensure reliability and efficiency when deployed in collaboration with travel agencies or visa-related services.

Collectively, these related studies demonstrate that combining retrieval and generation, supported by hybrid search and domain-focused evaluation, is a robust strategy for building a Japan visa chatbot assistant.
