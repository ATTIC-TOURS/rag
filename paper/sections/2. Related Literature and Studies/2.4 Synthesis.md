## 2.4 Synthesis

The reviewed literature and related studies provide a strong foundation for the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)â€“based chatbot. From the literature, the importance of embeddings, hybrid retrieval strategies (semantic and keyword search), indexing methods, reranking models, and evaluation frameworks has been established. These components are widely acknowledged as critical in reducing hallucinations, grounding large language model (LLM) responses, and improving efficiency and accuracy in conversational AI systems. Related studies demonstrate that chatbots have been successfully deployed in domains such as student services, legal assistance, and local government information systems, confirming the practicality and growing relevance of conversational AI in real-world settings.

Despite these contributions, several gaps remain. First, much of the existing work focuses on broad or generic domains, leaving limited attention to domain-specific datasets, such as Japan visa requirements in the Philippines. Second, while multilingual retrieval is discussed in theory, there is a lack of empirical studies evaluating systems that support English, Tagalog, and Japanese simultaneously within a visa assistance context. Third, the use of a pre-retrieval classifier to filter irrelevant queries and improve efficiency is not commonly explored in prior studies. Additionally, although hybrid search methods are documented, little evidence exists on how weighting strategies (e.g., 80% semantic + 20% keyword) perform specifically with structured administrative documents like visa requirements. Finally, many prototypes in previous studies are evaluated in laboratory settings, whereas few address deployment under resource constraints, such as local PC hosting with NGROK, Messenger delivery, and collaboration with a travel agency.

In response to these gaps, this thesis proposes a novel RAG-based chatbot prototype for Japan visa assistance in the Philippines. The system integrates official embassy resources and travel-agency datasets to ensure domain accuracy, supports multilingual interaction (English, Tagalog, and Japanese), and introduces a lightweight pre-retrieval classifier to optimize system efficiency. Furthermore, it evaluates hybrid retrieval weighting and chunking strategies on structured visa documents, while operating under realistic deployment constraints (local PC and NGROK integration with Messenger).

In summary, while existing literature and studies validate the effectiveness of RAG and hybrid retrieval approaches, there remains an underexplored intersection of localized dataset fusion, multilingual functionality, efficiency optimization, and deployment realism. This thesis addresses that intersection, offering a first-stage development prototype that contributes both practical insights and empirical evidence for applying RAG-based conversational AI in a specialized domain such as Japan visa assistance in the Philippines.
