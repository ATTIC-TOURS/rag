# 3. Research Design and Methodology

## 3.1 Introduction

This chapter outlines the research design and methodology used in developing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot prototype for Japan visa inquiries. It describes the system architecture, data collection and preparation, performance evaluation methods, respondent selection, and ethical safeguards. A conceptual framework diagram illustrates the end-to-end process: user queries sent via Messenger, processed through the Meta Webhook and FastAPI backend, and resolved through the RAG pipeline that integrates retrieval and generation components to deliver accurate, context-aware responses.
