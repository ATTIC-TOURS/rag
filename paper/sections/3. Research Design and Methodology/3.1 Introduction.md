# 3. Research Design and Methodology

## 3.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the research design and methodology employed in the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot prototype for Japan visa support. It details the processes undertaken in designing the system architecture, collecting and preparing the dataset, analyzing system performance, identifying respondents, and addressing ethical considerations. A conceptual framework diagram is also provided to illustrate the flow of interaction from the user through Messenger, the Meta webhook, the FastAPI backend, and into the RAG pipeline, which integrates retrieval and generation components to deliver accurate and context-aware responses.
