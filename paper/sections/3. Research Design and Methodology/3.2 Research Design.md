## 3.2 Research Design

The study adopts a developmental research design, focusing on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a prototype system. The chatbot system was developed as a proof-of-concept application to demonstrate how RAG techniques can be applied to Japan visa inquiries in the Philippine context. Additionally, an evaluation research approach was employed to assess system performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and usability.

The RAG-based chatbot is designed with the following components:

- Messenger and Meta Webhook – entry point where user queries are received.

- FastAPI Backend – processes queries, manages communication between components, and orchestrates the RAG pipeline.

- RAG Pipeline – composed of:

  - Retriever – responsible for retrieving relevant passages from pre-processed visa documents.

  - Generator (LLM) – generates natural language responses based on retrieved passages.

The evaluation of the system focused on two main aspects:

1. Performance Metrics

    - Latency: end-to-end response time, including internal pipeline delays.

    - Retrieval Accuracy: relevance of retrieved passages measured against ground-truth references.

    - Response Quality: clarity, correctness, and helpfulness of generated answers.

2. User-Centered Evaluation

    - Prototype tested and evaluated by respondents from travel agencies involved in visa processing.

    - Feedback gathered using a structured evaluation form (Likert scale + open-ended comments).

This combination of developmental and evaluative research designs ensures both technical validation and practical relevance of the system.
