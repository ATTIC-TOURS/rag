## 3.3 Data Collection

The dataset was drawn from three sources:

1. **Official Embassy Documents** – PDF guidelines and requirements from the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines.
2. **Travel Agency Resources** – procedural guides from accredited agencies.
3. **Synthetic Data** – user queries generated via a large language model (LLM) for:
   (a) binary classifier training,
   (b) query diversity in RAG evaluation,
   (c) retrieval robustness testing, and
   (d) response quality assessment.

### Data Processing and Storage

All data underwent preprocessing before integration into the vector database:

* **Embassy PDFs**: Each document was treated as a unit by visa category, cleaned of extraneous text, split into chunks (size adjusted by document length and embedding model limits), and enriched with LLM-generated summaries to improve semantic retrieval.
* **Synthetic Queries**: LLM-generated queries were manually reviewed for realism and alignment with official requirements.
* **Document Selection**: Only the latest requirements (as of April 2025) were retained; outdated materials were excluded.
* **Binary Classifier Dataset**: Queries were cleaned and tokenized, retaining essential terms to enhance classification accuracy and reduce noise.

This ensured the dataset was **accurate, current, and optimized** for retrieval and evaluation.
