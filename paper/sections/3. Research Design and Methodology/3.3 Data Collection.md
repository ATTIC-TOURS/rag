## 3.3 Data Collection

The dataset used in this study was sourced from multiple reliable references:

1. Official Embassy Documents – publicly available PDF guidelines and requirements from the Embassy of Japan in the Philippines.

2. Travel Agency Resources – information and procedural guides provided by accredited agencies.

3. Synthetic Data – additional user queries generated using a large language model (LLM) to expand the training set for intent classification and to simulate diverse user inputs.

### Data Processing and Storage

- PDF files were converted to structured text using parsing tools.

- Text was cleaned, segmented, and stored in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval.

- Synthetic queries were reviewed to ensure realism and alignment with official requirements.

- Only updated visa requirements (as of April 2025) were included, while outdated or redundant documents were excluded.

This process ensured that the dataset reflects the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive information for retrieval and response generation.
