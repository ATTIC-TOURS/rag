## 3.4 Data Analysis

The study applied both quantitative and qualitative methods of data analysis.

1. System Latency Analysis

    - Response times were measured using system logs.

    - Average, minimum, and maximum latencies were computed to assess efficiency.

2. Retrieval and Generation Evaluation

    - Retrieval performance was assessed using relevance scoring (precision, recall).

    - Generation quality was measured using both automated evaluation (BLEU/relevance checks) and human evaluation (respondents rating accuracy, helpfulness, and clarity).

3. User Feedback Analysis

    - Respondents provided ratings through a Likert scale survey.

    - Open-ended feedback was thematically analyzed to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.

By combining system-level metrics with user-centered evaluation, the study achieved a balanced analysis of both technical and experiential performance.
