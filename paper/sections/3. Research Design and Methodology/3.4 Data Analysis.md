## 3.4 Data Analysis

A **mixed-methods analysis** was conducted to capture both technical performance and user experience.

### a. Quantitative Analysis

* **Binary Classifier**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy derived from the confusion matrix.
* **Retriever & Generator**: RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, factual correctness, context recall, context precision).
* **System Latency**: Mean, median, and 95th percentile computed from system logs.
* **Usability Scores**: SUS responses converted to 0–100, then averaged.
* **Satisfaction Survey**: Likert responses summarized via means and distributions.

### b. Qualitative Analysis

* **Open-Ended Feedback**: Thematic coding of user and staff comments, identifying themes such as clarity, language handling (Tagalog/Taglish), trust, and usefulness.

### c. Integration of Findings

Quantitative metrics establish the chatbot’s **accuracy and efficiency**, while qualitative feedback highlights **usability and real-world value**. Together, they provide a holistic assessment of whether the system achieves the study’s objectives of improved responsiveness, consistency, and user satisfaction.
