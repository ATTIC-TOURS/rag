## 3.5 Respondents of the Study

Respondents include staff from accredited travel agencies in the Philippines, selected through purposive sampling for their direct role in assisting with Japan visa applications. They interacted with the prototype, evaluating response accuracy and usability.

A supplementary group of end-users (visa applicants) may also provide feedback on usability, though the primary evaluation rests with agency professionals.
