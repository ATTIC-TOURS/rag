## 3.5 Respondents of the Study

The primary respondents of this study were staff members from accredited travel agencies in the Philippines who are directly involved in assisting clients with Japan visa applications. These respondents were selected through purposive sampling, as they possess the necessary expertise to evaluate the systemâ€™s accuracy and usefulness.

Their role was to interact with the chatbot prototype, assess its performance in handling visa-related queries, and provide feedback regarding its reliability, accuracy, and usability.

Additionally, a small group of end-users (visa applicants) may be included to provide supplementary insights into usability and user experience, though the primary validation remains with agency professionals.
