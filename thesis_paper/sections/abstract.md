# Abstract

This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a chatbot system that assists users with Japan visa requirements using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system enhances answer accuracy by combining neural generation with document retrieval and incorporates a custom-trained intent classification model to improve relevance. The solution targets the travel industry and simplifies access to visa-related information.
